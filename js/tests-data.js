'R11-1':{type:'reading',title:'Reading — The Rise of Urban Rooftop Gardens',mins:30,
passage:`<p><b>Section A.</b> Rooftop farming was once dismissed as a hobby for idealists with too much time and too little soil. Today it has become a serious industry. In Paris, the world's largest urban farm spreads across 14,000 square metres of a building's roof and supplies fruit and vegetables directly to local residents. In Cairo, rooftop gardens have become a source of income for hundreds of families who sell herbs and salads to neighbourhood restaurants.</p>
<p><b>Section B.</b> The benefits extend well beyond fresh food. A green roof acts as a natural air conditioner, cutting a building's cooling costs by as much as 30 per cent. It absorbs rainwater that would otherwise overwhelm city drains during storms, and it offers a habitat for insects and birds whose natural spaces are shrinking year by year.</p>
<p><b>Section C.</b> City governments have started to take notice. Toronto became the first city in North America to make green roofs compulsory for new buildings above a certain size, and France now requires commercial rooftops to host either plants or solar panels. Property values, several studies suggest, rise noticeably when buildings carry living roofs.</p>
<p><b>Section D.</b> Critics warn of practical limits. Not every roof can bear the weight of deep soil, and installation remains expensive. Irrigation systems must be maintained, and during hot summers plants die without constant attention. Yet as climate pressures intensify, most urban planners now argue that the question is no longer whether cities should green their roofs, but how quickly they can afford to do it.</p>`,
